## Uptake curve

This plot shows the levels of exchange for each measured time point for each chosen peptide from the table on the left - the informativity is the same as `uptake curve` plots available in DynamX 3.0. 

Sometimes it is also referred to as `Kinetics`. 

Please keep in mind that the calculations are made for time points (shown on the plot as black dots), and the lines between them are just an approximation.
